Hogmannay !! The Tweds arrived in the afternoon, we had a huge party the guest list was Turbetts, Dunlops, Birrels, Lynne & Findlay, Pauline, her Mum & Ewan, Peter from next door, The Twits, Murrays pals - Elliot, Matthew, Amy & Lilly. It was a top night the kids plaid beer pong using Bacardi?! and Yweds and I stayed up until 2:30 sipping drams. A fitting end to 2022 and new beginning to 2023. Murray had all his mates stay in his room, they're a really good bunch of kids, I'm a very proud Dad.
