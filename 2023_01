Hangovers abound! Eventually we rallied the troops and took Poppy and Luna to Porty beach for a walk. The beach was rammed but it was a nice walk, Poppy loved her swim and she perked up a bit after that. Mary cooked us a Lasgane tea and then we watched Motherland and Tweds 7 I nursed a couple of beers.

A frosty start to the day. Team Tweds headed home and then Niamh and Lex came with me to the Nike store to buy Niamh new boots, I bagged a pair of cool new Nike Wildhorses for Â£42. We went to TK Max after that and had a laugh trying on stuff, I bought a Fat Moose fleece. Took Poppy up to the bush for a walk and to throw a rugby ball about with Niamh so she could try her new boots out, then I ran home. Off to Mary for leftover Lasagne.
